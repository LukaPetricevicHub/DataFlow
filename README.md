# Sales ETL Pipeline

This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for processing sales data. The main steps are:

1. **Extract** sales data from various sources.
2. **Transform** the data to clean and format it for analysis.
3. **Load** the transformed data into databases for further analysis.

## Customizability

This ETL pipeline is designed to be highly customizable. By adjusting the scripts and configurations, you can tailor the process to suit various data sources, transformation rules, and target databases. Key features include:

- **Data Extraction:** Modify the extraction scripts to pull data from different sources such as APIs, CSV files, or other databases.
- **Data Transformation:** Customize the transformation logic to clean and format the data according to your needs. This includes handling missing values, standardizing formats, and applying business rules.
- **Data Loading:** Configure the target database settings to load data into different databases such as MySQL, Hive, or any other SQL/NoSQL database.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Sales ETL Pipeline, follow these steps:

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-etl.git
    cd sales-etl
    ```

3. **Set up the environment:**
    - Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can use a virtual environment for isolation:
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

4. **Configure the environment variables:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set up the necessary environment variables. See the `.env.sample` file for an example.

### Usage

1. **Run the ETL script:**
    ```bash
    python sales_etl.py
    ```

2. **Database setup:**
    - Use the provided SQL scripts to create the necessary tables in your databases:
      - For Hive:
        ```bash
        hive -f create_hive_tables.sql
        ```
      - For MySQL:
        ```bash
        mysql -u username -p database_name < create_mysql_tables.sql
        ```

## Ideas for Extensions

Here are some ideas for further development:

- **Enhanced Data Extraction:** Incorporate additional data sources or APIs to enrich the sales data.
- **Advanced Transformations:** Implement more complex data transformation rules to handle edge cases and improve data quality.
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the ETL pipeline for faster processing and lower resource usage.
- **Error Handling and Logging:** Improve error handling mechanisms and add detailed logging for better monitoring and debugging.
- **Data Validation:** Implement data validation steps to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the transformed data.
